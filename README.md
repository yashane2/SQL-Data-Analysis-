# SQL-Data-Analysis
Welcome to the Maven Movies Database SQL Project! This repository showcases my exploration and analysis of a comprehensive movie dataset using SQL. Leveraging the power of SQL queries, I delved into the Maven Movies Database to uncover insightful patterns, trends, and interesting statistics about the world of cinema.
In this Maven Movies Database SQL Project, I harnessed the power of complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the extensive dataset. Through the application of advanced SQL techniques, I aimed to go beyond basic data retrieval and perform intricate analyses that unveil deeper patterns within the realm of cinema.
